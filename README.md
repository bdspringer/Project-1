# Project-1-Group-2
1st Project

This project will be an analysis of Air BnB data to help potential hosts make a decision on where to set up a new AirBnB in Washington DC.


Question 1: What is the distribution of AirBnB rentals throughout the District's neighborhoods? Are there certain areas with concentrated rentals?

Question 2: Price vs Density; Does a high density of AirBnB's correlate with lower prices?

Question 3: Annie's Project Question: "What is the price of AirBNB in relation to neighborhoods in D.C.?"
